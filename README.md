# Interrogatory Model Cards

> A proposal for interrogatory, low-friction model cards — **CAN • SHOULD • MUST**.

**Why:** Make model cards harder to obfuscate and easier to audit, without drowning authors in paperwork.

- Read the outline: **proposal.md**
- Handy links: **references.md**
- Coming soon: schema + example cards in `schema/` and `examples/`
